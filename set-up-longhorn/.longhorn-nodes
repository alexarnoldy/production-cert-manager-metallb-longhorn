## Provide a list of nodes that have the storage and compute resources to support workloads that will use Longhorn storage.
## The list will be input for SSH commands. 
## Providing SSH key exchange, i.e. ssh-keygen, will make these steps a bit easier (and more automated)
## Privide the SSH public key, or .pem file, as the IdentityFile below
#

HOST node1
  HOSTNAME 10.10.1.97
  USER ec2-user
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/short-term-kp.pem
