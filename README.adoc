# production-cert-manager-metallb-longhorn

## alex.arnoldy@suse.com

This repository contains directories that contain production ready deployments for MetalLB, cert-manager, and Longhorn.

* Each of the three projects can be deployed independently, if needed.

Enter each directory, in turn, and execute the commands in the prescribed order. 

* The first command in the MetalLB and cert-manager directories (as well as the .variables files) are hard-linked and are used to set the variables needed for those two installations.

** The Longhorn directory has a similar command to identify the cluster nodes that will run Longhorn.

* The advantage of this MetalLB pattern is that it provides an IPAddressPool for a primary purpose that will not be automatically assigned. This allows for a specific, permanent DNS resolution.
** In most applications, it would be desirable to provide this IP address to a ingress controller service.

** It also provides for an optional IPAddressPool with automatic IP address assignment to configured LoadBalancer services.

* The advantage of the cert-manager pattern is that it uses the DNS01 challenger to create the application TLS certificate. 
** This works well where the CA cannot directly access the application web server. 

** Note that the CA (Let's Encyrpt in this example) DOES need to be able to access the DNS provider (AWS Route53 in this example).
*** If someone leverages these instructions with a different DNS provider, please contact me. I'd like to extend this to at least one other provider.

** With this design, the hostname in the TLS certificate can resolve to a non-routable IP address (i.e. 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16) as long as the client can both resolve the FQDN to the correct IP address and access that IP address.

** After creating the TLS certificate, you can optionally remove the secret that holds your cloud credential secret token. This is more secure, but will prevent cert-manager from automatically updating the certificate before it expires.

* The advantage of this Longhorn pattern is that it can be deployed outside of SUSE Rancher. 
** The current design causes storage to be deployed on specific nodes. This allows deploying where nodes of different capacities are in use.

This repo is currently opinionated towards a suse-private-ai installation, but will lose that bias over time.

The versions of the projects used here are:

** cert-manager: v1.15.2

** MetalLB: 0.14.8

** Longhorn: 1.7.1
